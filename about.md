### Me

I consider myself as a software engineer who loves physics simulations, machine learning and popular science. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Ph. D degree in physics. Therefore, I learnt some minimal knowledge about physics in a wonderful town, <a href="/images/macfee.jpg">Blacksburg</a>. During my Ph. D time, I had one year experience in [coding and simulating](https://github.com/yanfeit/SSE) a quantum mechanical [toy model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model) by using a so called technique [Stochastic Series Expansion](http://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/research/ssehistory.html). I also spent almost one year in another beautiful town, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee"> Oak Ridge</a> which is a production site for the Manhattan Project. It continued to serve as the site of <a href="/images/lab.jpeg">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL). In the ORNL, I had an interesting research related with numerical inverse problem. This research lead my first publication under my [mentor's](https://web.ornl.gov/~maierta/) guide. After returning back from ORNL, I switched my research field from condensed matter physics to soft matter physics. These unique experience turned out to broaden my understanding of physics. I was exposed by lots of interesting subjects about polymers, colloidal suspension, chemisty, fluid dynamics and the most importantly [Molecular Dynamics Simulations](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) under [Prof. Cheng's](https://sites.google.com/a/vt.edu/shengfengcheng/) supervision. I enjoyed my Ph. D career on independent thinking and freedom to study different projects in my research field. As one of my teacher once said, quotes, *Not all of those problems will lead to papers*, these work without publications eventually lead to futile efforts in today's social evaluation system. However, the experience made my journey.
