### Me

I consider myself as a software engineer who loves physics simulations, machine learning and popular science. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Ph. D degree in physics. Therefore, I learnt some minimal knowledge about physics in a wonderful town, <a href="/images/macfee.jpg">Blacksburg</a>. During my Ph. D time, I had one year experience in [coding and simulating](https://github.com/yanfeit/SSE) a quantum mechanical [toy model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model) by using a so called technique [Stochastic Series Expansion](http://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/research/ssehistory.html). I also spent almost one year in another beautiful town, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee"> Oak Ridge,</a> which is a production site for the Manhattan Project. It continued to serve as the site of <a href="/images/lab.jpeg">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL). In the ORNL, I had an interesting research related with [numerical inverse problem](https://github.com/yanfeit/Maxent). This research lead my first publication under my [mentor's](https://web.ornl.gov/~maierta/) guide. After returning back from ORNL, I switched my research field from condensed matter physics to soft matter physics. These unique experience turned out to broaden my understanding of physics. I was exposed to lots of interesting subjects about polymers, colloidal suspension, chemisty, fluid dynamics and the most importantly [Molecular Dynamics Simulations](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) under [Prof. Shengfeng Cheng's](https://sites.google.com/a/vt.edu/shengfengcheng/) supervision. I enjoyed my Ph. D career on independent thinking and freedom to study different projects in my research field. As one of my teacher once said, quote, *Not all of those problems will lead to papers*, these work without publications eventually lead to futile efforts in today's social evaluation system. However, the *useless* experience made my journey. I eventually returned back to my mother country after my graduation. Now, I am empolyed in a privately owned enterprise.

### Quotes that I like OR make me laugh

<b>(20)</b> If a statistic falls in a reasonable part of the distribution, you must not make the mistake of concluding that the null hypothesis is “verified” or “proved.” That is the curse of statistics, that it can never prove things, only disprove them! At best, you can substantiate a hypothesis by ruling out, statistically, a whole long list of competing hypotheses, every one that has ever been proposed. After a while your adversaries and competitors will give up trying to think of alternative hypotheses, or else they will grow old and die, and then your hypothesis will become accepted. Sounds crazy, we know, but that’s how science works! <br><em>- Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling and Flannery in Numerical Recipes</em> <br>
<b>(19)</b> 阅读霍金，懂与不懂都是收获。  <br><em>- 书商推销霍金的《时间简史》用的广告语</em> <br>

<b>(17)</b> 看别人的代码还不如自己写一遍来的快。  <br><em>- 张宇钟</em> <br>
<b>(16)</b> You would rather kill me than make me read other people's codes.  <br><em>- Shengfeng Cheng joked in a group meeting</em> <br>
<b>(15)</b> Not all of those problems will lead to papers, but some should, and you should have, say, about four papers by the time you graduate. <br><em>- Eric Sharpe</em> <br>
<b>(14)</b> Too many good docs are getting out of the business. Too many OB-GYNs aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country. <br><em>- George W. Bush</em> <br>
