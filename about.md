### Me

I boldly consider myself as a computational physicist who loves physics simulations, machine learning and science. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Ph. D degree in physics. Therefore, I learnt some minimal knowledge about physics in a wonderful town, <a href="/images/macfee.jpg">Blacksburg</a>. During my Ph. D time, I had one year experience in [coding and simulating](https://github.com/yanfeit/SSE) a quantum mechanical [toy model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model) by using a so called technique [Stochastic Series Expansion](http://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/research/ssehistory.html). I also spent almost one year in another beautiful town, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee"> Oak Ridge,</a> which was a production site for the Manhattan Project. It continued to serve as the site of <a href="/images/lab.jpeg">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL). In the ORNL, I had an interesting research related with [numerical inverse problem](https://github.com/yanfeit/Maxent). This research lead my first publication under my [mentor's](https://web.ornl.gov/~maierta/) guide. After returning back from ORNL, I switched my research field from condensed matter physics to soft matter physics. These unique experience turned out to broaden my understanding of physics. I was exposed to lots of interesting subjects about polymers, colloidal suspension, chemisty, fluid dynamics and the most importantly [Molecular Dynamics Simulations](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) under [Prof. Shengfeng Cheng's](https://sites.google.com/a/vt.edu/shengfengcheng/) supervision. I enjoyed my Ph. D career on independent thinking and freedom to study different projects in my research field. As one of my teacher once said, quote, *Not all of those problems will lead to papers*, these work without publications eventually lead to futile efforts in today's social evaluation system. However, the *useless* experience made my journey. I eventually returned back to my mother country after my graduation.

### Quotes that I like OR make me laugh

<b>(44)</b> 卡尔萨根《宇宙》：但我们同时也在反向地影响着气候变化，使地球温度降低。几十万年来，人类一直在燃烧砍伐森林，放牧活动也破坏了大片草地。刀耕火种的农业，对热带森林的工业采伐以及过度放牧在今天仍然猖獗。事实上草原的颜色要比森林浅，而沙漠又比草原颜色更浅，而沙漠又比草原颜色更浅。结果就是地面吸收的太阳光越来越少，随着土地使用目的的改变，我们又在降低地球的表面温度。这种冷却作用有可能使得两极的冰帽面积增大。因为冰帽的颜色更加明亮，会使到达地球的太阳光更多地反射回去，进一步让这一颗行星降温，导致反照率效应不可控。 <br><em>- 我的评论：在上实际八十年代，即使是一流的天文学家和科普学者在面对气候变化这样的复杂问题时还是会存在严重误判。 <br>

<b>(43)</b> My enthusiam and optimism drove me, one evening in November 1976, to wander the streets of Pasadena until late into the night, struggling with myself over whether to propose that Caltech create a project to detect graviatational waves. The arguments in favor were obvious: for science in general, the enormous intellectual payoff if the project succeeded; for Caltech, the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of an exciting new field; for me, the possibility to have a team of experimenters at my hoe institution with whom to interact, instead of relying primarily on Braginsky and his team on the other side of the world, and the possibility to play a more central role than I could commuting to Moscow (and thereby have more fun). The argument against was also obvious: The project would be risky; to succeed, it would require large resources from Caltech and the U.S. National Science Foundation and enormous time and energy from me and others; and after all that investment, it might fail. It was much more risky than Caltech's entry into radio astronomy twenty-three years earlier. <br><em>- Kip S. Thorne<br>

<b>(42)</b> 发愤忘食，乐以忘忧，不知老之将至云尔。<br><em>-《论语》</em>有感于人生苦短。<br>

<b>(41)</b> I was impressed. Braginsky was clever, deep, and had excellent taste in physics; and he was warm and forthright, as easy to talk to about politics as about science. We quickly became close friends and learned to respect each other’s world views. For me, a liberal Democrat in the American spectrum, the freedom of the individual was paramount over all other considerations. No government should have the right to dictate how one lives one’s life. For Braginsky, a nondoctrinaire Communist, the responsibility of the individual to society was paramount. We are our brothers’ keepers, and well we should be in a world where evil people like Joseph Stalin can gain control if we are not vigilant. <br><em>- Kip S. Thorne </em> <br>

<b>(20)</b> If a statistic falls in a reasonable part of the distribution, you must not make the mistake of concluding that the null hypothesis is “verified” or “proved.” That is the curse of statistics, that it can never prove things, only disprove them! At best, you can substantiate a hypothesis by ruling out, statistically, a whole long list of competing hypotheses, every one that has ever been proposed. After a while your adversaries and competitors will give up trying to think of alternative hypotheses, or else they will grow old and die, and then your hypothesis will become accepted. Sounds crazy, we know, but that’s how science works! <br><em>- Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling and Flannery in Numerical Recipes</em> <br>
