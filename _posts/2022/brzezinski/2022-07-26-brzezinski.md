&emsp;&emsp;俄乌战争已经爆发了有5个月之久，最近布热津斯基的书，比如《大棋局-美国的首要地位及其地缘战略》又受到一轮关注，书里面关于俄罗斯的论述对于中国读者来说是比较新的，我第一遍读来的印象是苏联解体后的俄罗斯是如此不堪。以下收录一段布热津斯基的采访，同样来自于Charlie Rose的节目。

**Charlie Rose**: President Clinton's decision traveling China later this month has generated debate in Washington and around the world. Today the president defended his efforts to strengthen ties with China in a speech before the National Geographic Society in Washington. Pres.

**Bill Clinton**: When I travel to China, I will take part in an official greeting ceremony in front of the Great Hall of the People across from Tiananmen Square. I will do so because that is where the Chinese government receives visiting heads of state and government, including President Chirac of France and most recently Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. Some have suggested I should refuse to take part in this traditional ceremony, that somehow going there would absolve the Chinese government of its responsibility for the terrible killings at Tiananmen Square nine years ago or indicate that America is no longer concerned about such conduct. They are wrong. Protocol and honoring a nation's traditional practices should not be confused with principle. China's leaders, as I have repeatedly said, can only move beyond the events of June 1989, when they recognize the reality that what the government did was wrong. Sooner or later they must do that. And, perhaps even more important, they must change course on this fundamentally important issue.

**Charlie Rose**: Joining me now for a discussion on the upcoming trip and the issues it raises -- from Washington, ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI, former national security adviser for President Carter from 1977 to 1981. He is currently a counselor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and I am pleased to have him back on this program. You are in essential agreement with the president's trip and the purposes and what he hopes to get out of it and its expectations of what it means for the relationship between the United States and China. Correct?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Yes, basically I am. And the president said that his policy was both pragmatic and principled and, in effect, he was striking a balance between the two. In fact, I think it's more pragmatic than principled, but I think it has to be that way, given the stakes involved.

**Charlie Rose**: What are the stakes involved? And where is-- and where would you disagree because of the principle? But, go ahead, talk about the pragmatism and the stakes.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Well, the stakes are enormous. You know, China is becoming a major power. China will probably emerge in the next 10 to 20 years as the leading power in the Far East. Some go even further than that. They say that China will become a world power in our lifetime or the generation's lifetime in any case. This, I think, is exaggerated, but nonetheless it's clear that have a stable accommodating relationship with China is critical to global stability, to global development, to peace. But I think, therefore, the policy has to be pragmatic, and I think the president, while claiming that he's striking a balance between pragmatism and principle, in fact is opting for the pragmatic route, and he doesn't have much choice.

**Charlie Rose**: Then who's calling the shots in this relationship?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: I think the United States is the more influential power, and we are a global power whereas China is only an emerging regional power. So, we are in a position to define the framework and to take the initiative or to draw the limits. And, if we want to make China an enemy, we can do so. But I don't think that would be particularly fruitful for the United States.

**Charlie Rose**: Where have we drawn the limits?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Whave drawn the limits, for example, in terms of Chinese behavior towards Taiwan. We made it very clear to the Chinese that the use of force-- what otherwise is admitted by us to be an internal Chinese affair is not acceptable. We want Chinese cooperation in dealing with regional security in Northeast Asia, for example regarding Korea. These are the places where we want the Chinese to exercise restraint.

**Charlie Rose**: For your part of the conversation in Washington -- and you know the leaders both foreign and domestic who are involved themselves with these issues -- what I hear is the Chinese have been very helpful of recent, in terms of trying to deal with the Pakistan-India conflict and the nuclear testing and in other issues that they have come around to be positive.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Yeah. I mean, with some limits, I would say the Chinese, on the whole, are being relatively restrained and accommodating. They have opposed sanctions on Pakistan and they have leaned towards Pakistan, rather than towards India but that's understandable.

**Charlie Rose**: That's longstanding.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: What?

**Charlie Rose**: That's longstanding, isn't it?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: That's longstanding, and it's understandable, given their geopolitical situation. They probably have helped the Pakistanis acquire nuclear capability, and that makes us very uneasy. What's more troubling is they may be helping the Iranians, but we're not totally sure of that, but by and large, yes, I think it's fair to say that the Chinese are beginning to become part of the international process, rather than being a player apart.

**Charlie Rose**: To those people who say the president shouldn't have gone, what do you say?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**:  I would ask them--

**Charlie Rose**:  Or shouldn't plan to go.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Yeah, I would ask them, ''What would it accomplish?'' If not going-- Will it mean that China will become more democratic? Not going, will it mean that China will ease up on Tibet? Not going, does it mean that more human rights activists will be released? Not going, will it mean that China will become more open?

**Charlie Rose**:  Suppose they would say, ''Well, it'd show that the United States is serious about demanding change in China as a condition to the future relationship.''

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Well, but how effective would we be in that seriousness? It would mean that we are adopting a rhetorically moralistically satisfying position. But, would it really have any impact on the issues that I have raised? And I sort-of doubt that the answer is ''yes.''

**Charlie Rose**: Well, do you find yourself pretty much in agreement with Secretary Kissinger and others who believe that the best way to deal with the Chinese is in a sense to engage them sort of private diplomacy?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Yes, I do agree with that.

**Charlie Rose**: Because of the nature of them?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: And that's one of the reasons why I was so involved in normalizing relations with China some-- almost 20 years ago. It seems to me that China is such an important part of humanity that we have to incorporate it, co-opt it and by co-opting it contribute to changing it, that a policy of ostracism and pressure, which ultimately be mostly rhetorical and mostly conducted by us alone with no one else in the world helping us, is not gonna be as effective.

**Charlie Rose**:  What do you say to those people who say, ''Yes, go to China, but don't go to Tiananmen Square''?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Well, I can understand--

**Charlie Rose**: The symbol of the democracy movement.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: I think the symbolism is troubling, but the fact of the matter is there are certain protocols that countries themselves establish for themselves and for the way they receive foreign leaders. And I don't see how the president can say that Tiananmen is somehow off-limits to the Chinese leaders as well as to himself if he is the guest in China. I suppose the Chinese could find some symbolic aspect of our own history and geography and could place demands on us, and we wouldn't find that acceptable.

**Charlie Rose**: Where is the moral basis of your foreign policy?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Our moral basis is in our commitment to democracy, but our moral basis, which involves a commitment to democracy is not the totality of the substance of our foreign policy. We can't make that the only dimension of our relationship with the world.

**Charlie Rose**: I depends, it seems, in large part to what nation we're dealing with.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Yes. And that's an unfortunate reality.

**Charlie Rose**: It's a power reality reality--

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Yeah.

**Charlie Rose**: --rather than a moral reality.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: If we can compel a country -- for example, Haiti -- then we can, of course, say human rights or parliamentary elections is the issue and we're gonna send the Marines if you don't comply.

**Charlie Rose**: Or Panama.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: I you're dealing with a country of 1.2 billion people who have nuclear weapons and who have a history and a pride of their own and who have a culture of their own, I think we have to be a little more subtle and a little more pragmatic, alas.

**Charlie Rose**: Do you think the next century will be the American century? Or the--

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: I think it's more likely to be--

**Charlie Rose**: --Chinese century?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: I think it's more likely to be the American century because I don't accept the argument of those who take China's GNP and the project it forward mechanically on the assumption it will grow at 7 percent per annum and then say, ''Yes, by 2020, China will be the number one economy in the world and, therefore, a superpower.'' In fact, power is much more complex than just economic statistics, and of course any automatic, mechanical projection like that is likely to be derailed. You probably remember, Charlie, that 15 years ago people were making the same projections regarding Japan and the United States. Japan was supposed to be the superstate that will supplant us.

**Charlie Rose**: So--

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Look where these predictions are.

**Charlie Rose**: So, that's an interesting question. What the most important relationship for us in-- as we enter the next century -- Japan or China?

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: That's a very tough question to answer. And the way I answer it is by differentiating between the roles the two can play. I think the relationship with Japan is vitally important because Japan can become a truly global civic leader, a force for good in the world, and a major constructive international influence. But it will not be a dominant regional power in Asia because the other Asians don't want it to be so. And, in fact, Japan hasn't reconciled yet with some of its former enemies. China is likely to be the dominant regional power in a more traditional geopolitical sense. And, therefore, in different ways we have to pursue the relationship with each, making certain that neither feels slightened and making certain that we do not seem to be aligning with either against the other.

**Charlie Rose**: Dr. Brzezinski, as always, thank you very much for joining me.

**Zbigniew Brzezinski**: Nice to be with you, Charlie.

**Charlie Rose**: Pleasure.
