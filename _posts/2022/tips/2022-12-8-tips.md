&emsp;&emsp;¬†Some useful tips about Linux commands, programming skills and else. I am continuing add these tips to save my bad memory. üòÇ

# Linux Commands

#### grep

[Find all files containing specific text (string) on Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/how-to-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-string-on-linux)

```bash
grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere' -e 'pattern'
```

- <code>-r</code> or <code>-R</code> is recursive,
- <code>-n</code> is line number, and
- <code>-w</code> stands for match the whole word.
- <code>-l</code> (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
- <code>-e</code> is the pattern used during the search

Along with these, <code>--exclude</code>, <code>--include</code>, <code>--exclude-dir</code> flags could be used for efficient searching:

- This will only searching through those files which have .c or .h extensions:

```bash
grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
```

- This will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension:

```bash
grep --exclude=\*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
```

- For directories it's possible to exclude one or more directories using the <code>--exclude-dir</code> parameter. For example, this will exclude the dirs <code>dir1/</code>, <code>dir2/</code> and all of them matching <code>*.dst/</code>:

```bash
grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/search/' -e "pattern"
```

#### sshpass

If we want to ssh into the serve with a single command line, we can use <code>sshpass</code>. To get command by

```bash
sudo apt-get install sshpass
```

Example:

```bash
sshpass -p 'mySSHPasswordHere' ssh username@server.nixcraft.net.in
```



# Programming

Read arguments from the input is useful. Below is a typical method to read arguments in C programming.

```c++
for(int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
  if((strcmp(argv[i], "-i") == 0) || (strcmp(argv[i], "--input_file") == 0)) {
    input_file = argv[++i];
    continue;
    }
}
```





# Message Passing Interface

I take the tips from the website [mpitutorial](https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/mpi-hello-world/).



## Basic 

```c++
MPI_Init(int* argc, char** argv)
```

During <code>MPI_Init</code>, all of MPI's global and internal variables are constructed. For example, a communicator is formed around all of the processes that were spawned, and unique ranks are assigned to each process.



```c++
MPI_Comm_size(MPI_Comm communicator, int* size)
```

<code>MPI_Comm_size</code> returns the size of a communicator. For example, 

```c++
MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);
```

<code>MPI_COMM_WORLD</code> encloses all of the processes in the job. Therefore, this call should return the amount of processes that were requested for the job.



```c++
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_Comm communicator, int* rank)
```

 <code>MPI_Comm_rank</code> returns the rank of a process in a communicator. Each process inside of a communicator is assigned an incremental rank starting from **zero**. 



A miscellaneous and less-used function is:

```c++
MPI_Get_processor_name(char* name, int* name_length)
```

<code>MPI_Get_processor_name</code> obtains the actual name of the processor on which the process is executing. 



```c++
MPI_Finalize()
```

<code>MPI_Finalize()</code> is used to clean up the MPI environment. No more MPI calls can be made after this one.



## Send and Receive

```c++
MPI_Send(void* data, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int destination, int tag, MPI_Comm communicator)

MPI_Recv(void* data, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source,      int tag, MPI_Comm communicator, MPI_Status* status)
```

The first argument is data buffer. The second and third arguments describes the count and type of elements that reside in the buffer. <code>MPI_Send</code> sends the exact count of elements, and <code>MPI_Recv</code> will receive **at most** the count of elements. The fourth and fifth arguments specify the rank of the sending/receiving process and the tag of the message. The sixth argument specifies the communicator and the last argument (for <code>MPI_Recv</code> only) provides information about the received message. 









# OpenMP

Here we will introduce the basic instructions for OpenMP. In C/C++, the format for the instructions is, 

```c++
#pragma omp instrct [clause [clause]...]
```

For example, 

```c++
#pragma omp parallel private(i,j)
```

<code>parallel</code> is the instruction, <code>private</code> is the clause.



## OpenMP instruction sets

| instructions      | details                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| parallel          | indicates the following codes will be executed in parallel   |
| for               | used before the for loop. The for loop is assigned in multiple threads to be executed in parallel. The irrelevances between the loops is guaranteed. |
| parallel for      | a combination of  parallel and for instructions, used before the for loops which indicates the for loops will be executed in multiple threads in parallel. |
| sections          | used before the codes that might be executed in parallel.    |
| parallel sections | a combination of parallel and sections.                      |
| critical          | used before a critical region of the code                    |
| single            | indicates the following codes shall be executed in a single thread. |
| flush             | to ensure that the temporary memory is consistent with the actual memory. That is, the shared memory is consistent in all the threads. |
| barrier           | all the threads stop when they meet barrier instruction.     |
| atomic            | assign one memory to update.                                 |
| master            | assign codes to be executed in the main pragram.             |
| ordered           |                                                              |
| threadprivate     |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |
