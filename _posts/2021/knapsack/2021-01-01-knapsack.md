&emsp;&emsp;Â Knapsack problem is widely encoutered in the real-worlds. When I was a freshman employee in the Alibaba group, this problem was the first technical problem that our team solved.

In the online advertisement or during the sales promotion, the business operator decides to give the app user coupons of different values to maximize different sales goal, such as profit, GMVs, new users and so on. In the meantime, the business operator is constrained by several factors, such as budgets, promotion duration, coupon's value limits and so on. According to the business description, there are several ways to build a model to help operator to accomplish the sales goal. Some typical model can be build upon on a 0/1 knapsack problem, a Markov decision process problem or even a reinforcement learning problem. 
The mathematical description of the multidimesional knapsack problem is as follows,

$$
\max \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M} p_{ij}x_{ij} \\
\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M b_{ijk}x_{ij} \le B_k, \quad \forall k \in [K] \\ 
\sum_{j=1}^M x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall i \in [N] \\
x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i \in [N], \forall j \in [M] \tag{1}
$$

It is a typical decription for a operational research problem. The format looks a little bit terrifying at the first time. Let me explain the mathematical symbols by starting with the subscripts. The subscript $i$ is the index of the  $x_{ij}$ is the decision variables that nees to figure out in the solving routine.
