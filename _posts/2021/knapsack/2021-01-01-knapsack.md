&emsp;&emsp;Â Knapsack problem is widely encoutered in the real-worlds. When I was a freshman employee in the Alibaba group, this problem is the first technical problem that we solved.

The mathematical description of the multidimesional knapsack problem is as follows,

$$
\max \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M} p_{ij}x_{ij} \\
\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M b_{ijk}x_{ij} \le B_k, \quad \forall k \in [K] \\ 
\sum_{j=1}^M x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall i \in [N] \\
x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i \in [N], \forall j \in [M] \tag{1}
$$

It is a typical decription for a operational research problem. The format looks a little bit terrifying at the first time. Let me explain the mathematical symbols. $x_{ij}$ is the decision variables that nees to figure out in the solving routine.
