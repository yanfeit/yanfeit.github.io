				Hi, I am Yanfei Tang. I am currently seeking a job opportunity in China. Previously, I was a research assistant in Physics department with <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/vt.edu/shengfengcheng/">Shengfeng Cheng</a>, since late 2015 at Virginia Tech of Blacksburg. I graudated with a Ph.D degree on December 2018.

				My research is about the molecular dynamics simulations of soft matter physics, such as modeling evaporation of colloidal thin films, capillary and wetting phenomena, polyelectrolytes complexation. Before I joined Dr. Cheng's group, I was at Oak Ridge National Lab where I worked with <a href="https://web.ornl.gov/~maierta/">Thomas Maier</a> on integral inversion of Green's functions. I was also interested in compuational condensed matter physics with quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
